# Hi there, I'm Dechathon Niamsa-ard! 👋

### 🎓 M.Sc. Student in Data Science & AI | Asian Institute of Technology (AIT)

I am currently navigating the world of Data Science, moving from theory to application. My GitHub serves as a repository for my academic assignments, algorithm implementations from scratch, and full-stack data projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently studying **Machine Learning, Data Modeling, and Deep Learning**
- 🧠 I focus on understanding the **Math behind the models** (Linear Algebra, Calculus)
- 📝 This profile hosts my coursework and self-study projects

### 📚 Academic Projects & Coursework

#### 🚗 [Car Price Prediction & Analytics](https://github.com/dniamsaard4codework/YOUR_REPO_NAME_HERE)
*Course: Machine Learning (AT82.03)*
A comprehensive study on regression analysis comparing industry libraries vs. custom implementations.
* **Objective:** Predict car prices using multiple approaches to understand model behavior.
* **Key Learnings:**
    * Implemented **Linear Regression from scratch** (Gradient Descent, Regularization) without Scikit-Learn.
    * Compared performance against **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**.
    * Deployed a dashboard using **Dash** and **Docker** to visualize feature importance.

#### 📉 Statistical Learning & Algorithms
*Repositories focused on building algorithms from the ground up.*
* **Gradient Descent:** Manual implementation to understand convergence and learning rates.
* **Logistic Regression:** Built a custom classifier to understand probability thresholds.
* **Data Cleaning:** Scripts for handling missing values and outlier detection in real-world datasets.
